# Configuration File

This folder contains the configuration file required for the bot to function properly.

## Instructions

- Replace the placeholder configurations with the actual token you generate.
- Ensure that the token is valid and has the necessary permissions for your bot.
- Do **not** share your token publicly or commit it to version control.

## Example

```json
{
  "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
}
