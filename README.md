# Discord-Bot

A custom Discord bot built for use in my server to enhance moderation and bring a more engaging, fun experience for users.

## About the Bot

I originally created this bot to bypass Nitro restrictions and use Nitro emotes without paying for a subscription. Over time, I added several entertaining features to keep the server lively and interactive.

### Features

- ðŸš€ Send Nitro emotes without having Nitro
- ðŸ˜Ž Impersonate users and send messages on their behalf
- ðŸŽ­ Run fun fake commands like fake bans
- ðŸŽ® Play simple games
- âœ¨ Additional utilities and fun interactions to keep users engaged

## Setup Instructions

This repository contains only the source code. To run the bot, youâ€™ll need to:

1. Install the required packages (dependencies).
2. Rebuild the project after installing the dependencies.
3. Replace the configuration values (like your bot token) as needed.

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure youâ€™re using the correct version of the libraries for compatibility.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this bot in your own servers. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
